House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

Project Overview This project aims to predict house prices using a Linear Regression model based on key features such as lot area, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.
The objective is to explore how different property characteristics influence the overall selling price and to build a model that can accurately estimate prices for new data. Steps Involved

Data Loading: Imported and explored the housing dataset.
Feature Selection: Selected features like LotArea, BedroomAbvGr, and HalfBath for prediction.
Model Building: Implemented Linear Regression using Scikit-Learn.
Model Evaluation: Calculated performance metrics such as R² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
5.Visualization: Visualized relationships between features and the predicted prices using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Technologies Used

Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-Learn

Output

Predicted house prices based on input features
Graphs showing actual vs. predicted prices
Evaluation metrics to assess model accuracy
Learning Outcome Through this task, I learned how to:
Apply Linear Regression for supervised learning problems
Perform data preprocessing and feature selection
Visualize and interpret regression results effectively
